.. Oneoffs
   Oneoff Jai programs of varying use for
   various tasks.


.. Details
   - sheet.jai, annotation replacement tool
   - write.jai, markup tool
   - m8.jai, bash-alternative scripting language
   - text.jai, plaintext formatting tool


.. Installation
   Most programs rely on my 'base.jai' module
   which you can pull with:

      git submodule init
      git submodule update --recursive

   This should create a 'base' directory, and
   afterwards, everything can be compiled
   using:

      jai name-of-program.jai

   This will create a 'bin/' folder and the
   output executable within said folder.
